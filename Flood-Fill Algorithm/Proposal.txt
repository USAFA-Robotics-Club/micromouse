- CS210 FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL, Fall 2022
===========================================================================
- Maze Running Simulation
- Name: Victor Chen
- Section: T 6/7
- Documentation Statement:  None
===========================================================================

OVERVIEW:
This is where you will write a brief description of your project.  You do not need to write a lot, but you do need to provide enough detail for your instructor to get a good understanding of what you would like to do.

   For this project I will be implementing a maze running robot simulation,
which will tie into running a program for the Micromouse competition. I will
attempt to create a program that somehow gets through the maze simulation.

INTERFACE MECHANISM:
How will users interact with your program?  Is it with Curses, command line, etc?
   I am trying to decide whether to use Curses or command lines to display the
maze simulation. For now, both interfaces seem to be workable options.

===========================================================================
Required Programming Skills (must have 5 of 6):
   -- Leave blank if you aren't planning on implementing.
   1) Dynamic Memory Allocation
	How are you going to meet this req:

      I will attempt to create a dynamically created array of structs that contains
   information of each walls and openings within each cell. This simulated robot may
   also dynamically allocate memory as it runs through the maze.

   2) Pointers
	How are you going to meet this req:

      I will use pointers to access cell information as the robot runs through the maze.

   3) File I/O
	How are you going to meet this req:

      I will create files that will become the maze formats, so the program will need to 
   initialize by reading in the maze file. Or I could probably use pointers with structs,
   which may require file I/O.

   4) Structs
	How are you going to meet this req:

      I will use structs to hold cell values (for if there is a wall or not) within the 
   maze simulation.

   5) String Manipulation
	How are you going to meet this req:

      If I do end up using file I/O, I may need to implement some sort of string 
   manipulation on reading the maze format file.

   6) Processing of Array Data
	How are you going to meet this req:

      I will need to process the data from the array of structs I will create from the
   maze file. This array data will be read and processed as the robot runs through
   the maze.

Required Advanced Programming Skills (1 of the below):
   -- Leave blank if you aren't planning on implementing.
   1) Recursion
	How are you going to meet this req:

   2) 2D Dynamic Memory
	How are you going to meet this req:

      I will implement a 2D dynamic array that is created to hold a struct value of
   what is contained within the cell (the walls)
